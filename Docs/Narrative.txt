After the town of Pleasant View suffers a zombie outbreak, there is only one survivor — Dan the Delivery Man.

Realizing this crisis offers him a unique business opportunity, Dan heads to the local morgue. He fills his delivery van full of brains.

He arranges a meeting with the zombie mayor and they reach an agreement where Dan won't get eaten as long as he keeps deliverying fresh brains to the residents.

Guide Dan down the roads of Pleasant View and deliver the brains to the resident's doorsteps. Watch out for other drivers — zombies are notoriously bad at driving.

Good luck!
