## Game Details
After the town of Pleasant View suffers a zombie outbreak, there is only one survivor — Dan the Delivery Man. 
He arranges a meeting with the zombie mayor and they reach an agreement where Dan won't get eaten as long as he keeps delivering fresh brains to the undead residents.
Guide Dan down the roads of Pleasant View and deliver the brains to the resident's doorsteps. Watch out for other drivers — zombies are notoriously bad at driving.
Good luck!
Game made for the GameDev.TV 2022 game jam in 10 days.
